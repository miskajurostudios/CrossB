# If you want to compile
If you want to compile this, Follow these instructions;

1. Compile these as 2 diffrent EXEs, as (especially this one) `settings.exe` and `CrossB.exe`.
2. When compiling `settings.exe` make sure to include the `Assets` folder.
3. `settings.exe` just makes and edits folder `Settings` (It will be created after running) and basicly you won't really need `settings.exe` if you won't edit it furder.
