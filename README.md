# CrossB
CrossB is a open-source software that I made, It just basicly makes Crosshair on your screen,
there are multiple versions of it; 3 diffrent colors and 3 diffrent types.
You can adjust the X and Y position however you want.

# Download
You can download CrossB [here](https://github.com/miskajurostudios/CrossB/releases).

### There are default Key Shortcuts:
Toggle Cross - Shift + F8
Open Settings - Ctrl + Shift + F8
Quit CrossB - Esc + F8
(You can customize it however you want)

### There might be some bugs or glitchs so please report them :D
Also I would really appreciate your help <3
