# CrossB
CrossB is a open-source software that I made, It just basicly makes Crosshair on your screen,
there are multiple versions of it; 3 diffrent colors and 3 diffrent types.
You can adjust the X and Y position however you want.

# Download
You can download CrossB [here](https://github.com/miskajurostudios/CrossB/releases).

### Default Key Shortcuts:
Toggle Cross - Shift + F8
Open Settings - Ctrl + Shift + F8
Quit CrossB - Esc + F8
(You can customize it however you want)

# ISSUES ⚠️
_Issues that I know about, but actually have NO idea to fix... yea I know I'm such a good developer right?_

1. **Unresponding after a while** the CrossB program becomes unresponding after a while, I'm not sure if this is just problem in python because it's listening constantly for keybinds. And well it just becomes slower and slower and eventually doesn't respond. so yea basicly you are gonna need to kill it using task manager, or just after a while press some keybind (eg.: Shift+F8 two times).
2. **Cross NOT ontop** the Cross sometimes just is under some other window, I'm not sure why, but yea.

# What I want to add
_I'm going to write things here that I would want to add to CrossB_

1. **Custom Crosshairs** _I cloud add something that will allow to have custom Crosshairs._
2. **Position Picker** _You can set the Offset of X and Y, but I think it would be easier to just have some kind of position picker build in._

### There might be some bugs or glitchs so please report them :D
Also I would really appreciate your help <3
